    "\"*[Machine learning](https://github.com/georgetown-analytics/machine-learning/blob/master/notebook/Tour%20de%20SciKit-Learn.ipynb) can classically be summarized with two methodologies: supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, the “correct answers” are annotated ahead of time and the algorithm tries to fit a decision space based on those answers. In unsupervised learning, algorithms try to group like examples together, inferring similarities via distance metrics. Machine learning allows us to handle new data in a meaningful way, predicting where new data will fit into our models.*\"\n",

    "We will be conducting supervised learning. \n",

    "**Null Values**\n",
    "   * Sklearn doesn't deal handle *Null* values. \n",
    "   * While the data is fairly clean there are *Null* values that occur in the publication origin lagged variables. This is due to date ranges where there were no publication from a given county/region. Solutions:\n",
    "      * Recode missing values to 0. This has the downside that it introduces bias. \n",
    "      * Drop the values with missing data. This is the route I would go, since most of the missing values occur before the Syrian crises began (2010). Regardless, this is something we'll talk about when we discuss the limitations of our model. "
