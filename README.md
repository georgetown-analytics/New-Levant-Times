**Abstract**
How informative is news coverage of geopolitical conflicts? Can text analysis be used to predict important events before they unfold? The civil war in Syria has been a protracted and deadly conflict. The intensity and duration of the conflict has led to widespread news coverage from around the globe. We leveraged this to conduct two text analysis models: measuring the sentiment of news articles ex ante on events we classified, and alternatively, using machine learning to find which individual words were most predictive of the same classified events. The results from the former were mixed. Middle Eastern newspapers were most predictive but failed to outperform any other regions when we included days that we did not explicitly classify. The latter method was more promising. Tests on the complete article corpus yielded accurate classifications 60% of the time.
